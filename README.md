# Microservices - A Modular Approach to Development

I wanted to explore microservices by creating a small application.

## Concept Overview
Microservices function like **Lego blocks**—instead of building a single, massive structure, each block (microservice) has a specific function and can be swapped, upgraded, or added independently.

Rather than relying on **one giant system**, microservices work like a **team of superheroes**—each service has its own unique capability and works together seamlessly. This architecture offers **Flexibility**, **Speed**, **Manageability** and **Resilience**

## Features
- **Decoupled Microservices** for better scalability and maintenance.
- **Independent Databases** to ensure autonomy between services.
- **API Communication** between microservices.
- **Efficient Deployment** using containerization and orchestration.

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Eureka Server (Service Discovery)
- API Gateway
- PostgreSQL / Mongo Databases
