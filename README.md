# Microservices - A Modular Approach to Development # 
I wanted to explore microservices by creating a small application based on the concepts covered in lectures.

## Concept Overview ## 
Think of microservices as Lego blocksâ€”instead of building a single, massive structure, each block (microservice) has a specific function and can be swapped, upgraded, or added independently.

Rather than relying on one giant system, microservices function like a team of superheroesâ€”each service has its own unique "superpower" and works together seamlessly. This architecture offers:
âœ… Flexibility â€“ Easily modify or scale individual services.
âœ… Speed â€“ Faster development and deployment cycles.
âœ… Manageability â€“ Each service is independent and easier to maintain.
âœ… Resilience â€“ Updates can be made without disrupting the entire system.
