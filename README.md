# Microservices - A Modular Approach to Development

I wanted to explore microservices by creating a small application based on the concepts covered in lectures.

## 🚀 Concept Overview
Microservices function like **Lego blocks**—instead of building a single, massive structure, each block (microservice) has a specific function and can be swapped, upgraded, or added independently.

Rather than relying on **one giant system**, microservices work like a **team of superheroes**—each service has its own unique capability and works together seamlessly. This architecture offers:

✅ **Flexibility** – Easily modify or scale individual services.  
✅ **Speed** – Faster development and deployment cycles.  
✅ **Manageability** – Each service is independent and easier to maintain.  
✅ **Resilience** – Updates can be made without disrupting the entire system.  

## 📌 Features
- **Decoupled Microservices** for better scalability and maintenance.
- **Independent Databases** to ensure autonomy between services.
- **API Communication** between microservices.
- **Efficient Deployment** using containerization and orchestration.
